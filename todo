to do:
check for buildtools

git checkout for qms not working
git for user some issue
setx for insted of this find better method possibly registry method

delayed expansion for all variables

removed pause caused some other side issues
python requires UAC, move to UAC section
mysql, apache required UAC for start

some weird char before git command


before setx get the collectivepath and append to path then
keep the python and java in temp variable, append before setx only once
